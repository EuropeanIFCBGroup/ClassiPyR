\title{Load classifications from CSV file (validation mode)}
\usage{
load_from_csv(csv_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{csv_path}{Path to classification CSV file}
}
\value{
Data frame with classifications. Expected columns: `file_name`,
  `class_name`, and optionally `score`.
}
\description{
Reads a classification CSV file and returns a data frame with classifications.
Class names are processed to truncate trailing numbers (matching iRfcb behavior).
}
\details{
The CSV file must contain the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{file_name}{Image filename including the `.png` extension
    (e.g., `D20230101T120000_IFCB134_00001.png`).}
  \item{class_name}{Predicted class name (e.g., `Diatom`).}
}

An optional column may also be included:
\describe{
  \item{score}{Classification confidence value between 0 and 1.}
}

The CSV file must be named after the sample it describes
(e.g., `D20230101T120000_IFCB134.csv`) and placed inside the Classification
Folder configured in the app (subfolders are searched recursively).
}

# Load classifications from a CSV file
classifications <- load_from_csv("/path/to/D20230101T120000_IFCB134.csv")

}
