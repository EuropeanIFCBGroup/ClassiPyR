\description{
Scans the configured (or specified) ROI, classification, and output folders
for IFCB sample files and saves the results to the file index cache.
This can be called outside the Shiny app, e.g. from a cron job, to keep
the cache up to date without manually clicking the rescan button.
}
\details{
If folder paths are not provided, they are read from saved settings.
