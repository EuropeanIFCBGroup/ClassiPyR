This tutorial walks you through your first session with `ClassiPyR`.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:

1. The package installed (see [Installation](https://europeanifcbgroup.github.io/ClassiPyR/))
2. Your IFCB data files (ROI, ADC, HDR)
3. Optionally: a class list file (.mat or .txt) - you can also create one from scratch in the app
4. Optionally: existing classifications (CSV or classifier MAT files, see below)

### Python Requirements

Python is required for saving annotations as MATLAB .mat files for use with [ifcb-analysis](https://github.com/hsosik/ifcb-analysis). Reading existing .mat files (annotations, classifier output, class lists) does not require Python.

If you only need to read .mat files or work with CSV classification files, Python is not required.

### CSV Classification Format

If you have existing classifications in CSV format, each file must be named after its sample (e.g., `D20230101T120000_IFCB134.csv`) and contain at least these columns:

```
file_name,class_name
D20230101T120000_IFCB134_00001.png,Diatom
D20230101T120000_IFCB134_00002.png,Ciliate
```

An optional `score` column (confidence values between 0 and 1) can also be included. See the [User Guide](user-guide.html) for more details.

### Python Setup

To set up Python:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(iRfcb)
ifcb_py_install(envname = "./venv")  # Creates venv in current working directory
```

---

## Step 1: Configure Settings

Launch the app:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ClassiPyR)
run_app()

# Or specify a custom Python virtual environment path (takes priority over saved settings)
run_app(venv_path = "/path/to/your/venv")
```

Click the **gear icon** next to your username in the sidebar.

</a>
<p><em>Settings dialog showing folder configuration options. Click to enlarge.</em></p>

Configure your folders using the built-in folder browser:

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Classification Folder | Where your CSV/MAT classifications are | `/ifcb/classified/` |
| ROI Data Folder | Where your IFCB raw files are | `/ifcb/raw/` |
| Output Folder | Where annotations will be saved | `/ifcb/manual/` |
| PNG Output Folder | Where images will be organized | `/ifcb/png/` |

Click **Save Settings**. The app will scan your folders and build a file index cache for fast loading.

> **Note**: The Python virtual environment path is configured via `run_app(venv_path = ...)` and remembered for future sessions. See the [FAQ](faq.html) for details on how the path is resolved.

---

## Step 2: Set Up Your Class List

You have two options for setting up your class list:

### Option A: Load an Existing Class List

If you have an existing class list file:

1. In Settings, click **Browse** next to "Class List File"
2. Select your `.mat` or `.txt` file
3. The app will confirm how many classes were loaded

### Option B: Create a Class List from Scratch

If you're starting a new project without a class list:

1. Click **Edit Class List** in Settings (no need to upload a file first)
2. Add classes using one of these methods:
   - Type a class name in "Add new class" field and click **Add to End**
   - Type or paste multiple classes (one per line) in the text area and click **Apply Changes**
3. The app will create a temporary class list automatically
4. **Important**: Click **Save as .mat** or **Save as .txt** to save your class list for future sessions

> **Tip**: You can start annotating immediately after creating classes - the app handles the temporary file automatically.

---

## Step 3: Select a Sample

Choose a **Year** from the dropdown.

Optionally filter by **Month**.

Select **Show**:

- *All samples*: See everything
- *Auto-classified (validation)*: Samples with existing auto-classifications
- *Manually annotated*: Samples you've previously annotated
- *Unannotated*: New samples (annotation from scratch)

Choose a sample from the dropdown:

- ✎ = Has manual annotation
- ✓ = Has auto-classification
- ✎✓ = Has both (can switch between modes)
- \* = Unannotated (new sample)

</a>
<p><em>Sample browser with year/month filters. Click to enlarge.</em></p>

Click **Load**.

> **Tip**: If your sample list seems out of date, click the **Sync** button (circular arrow icon) next to the navigation buttons to rescan your folders.

> **Tip**: Samples with ✎✓ let you switch between viewing your manual annotations and the auto-classifications using a button in the header.

## Step 4: Review Images

Once loaded, you'll see the Image Gallery:

<a href="https://europeanifcbgroup.github.io/ClassiPyR/reference/figures/gallery-view.png">
<img src="https://europeanifcbgroup.github.io/ClassiPyR/reference/figures/gallery-view.png" alt="Image gallery showing classified plankton images grouped by class." style="max-width:100%;">
</a>
<p><em>Image gallery showing classified plankton images grouped by class. Click to enlarge.</em></p>

- Images are grouped by class
- Each image shows its ROI number
- Relabeled images have yellow borders
- Classification scores are shown (if available)

### Navigation

- Use **Filter by Class** to focus on one class
- Use **pagination** to navigate through pages
- Change images per page (50/100/200/500)

---

## Step 5: Make Annotations

### Selecting Images

**Single click**: Select/deselect one image

**Drag select**:

1. Click and hold in an empty area
2. Drag to create a selection box
3. All images in the box are selected

**Batch select**:

- **Select All**: Select all visible images
- **Deselect**: Clear selection

### Relabeling

1. Select one or more images
2. Type or search for a class in "Relabel to"
3. Click **Relabel**

<a href="https://europeanifcbgroup.github.io/ClassiPyR/reference/figures/relabel-workflow.png">
<img src="https://europeanifcbgroup.github.io/ClassiPyR/reference/figures/relabel-workflow.png" alt="Relabeling workflow: selected images (blue borders) ready to be assigned a new class." style="max-width:100%;">
</a>
<p><em>Relabeling workflow: selected images (blue borders) ready to be assigned a new class. Click to enlarge.</em></p>

The images will move to their new class group.

## Step 6: Save Your Work

Click **Save Annotations** to save:

- MAT file for MATLAB compatibility (requires Python; for use with [ifcb-analysis](https://github.com/hsosik/ifcb-analysis))
- Statistics CSV with accuracy metrics
- PNGs organized by class

### Auto-save

Work is automatically saved when:

- You navigate to another sample
- You close the app (attempts to save)

---

## Tips for Efficient Annotation

1. **Start with large classes** - Use "Filter by Class" to focus on abundant taxa

2. **Use drag-select** - Much faster than clicking individual images

3. **Sort by size** - Images are sorted by ROI area, grouping similar organisms

4. **Check statistics** - The "Validation Statistics" tab shows your progress
